# get-5-star-google-rating
I have created a Google Rating page for our business using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This page is designed to maximize positive reviews and manage feedback effectively. When a user gives a 5-star rating, they are redirected to the official Google review page to submit their review. If the user rates less than 5 stars, the review remains on our internal dashboard, allowing the feedback to be submitted without being posted on Google.

Key Benefits:
Boosted 5-Star Reviews: By directing only 5-star raters to the Google review page, we increase the likelihood of receiving more positive reviews.
Controlled Feedback: Lower ratings are captured internally, enabling us to address issues privately and improve our services.
Enhanced Customer Experience: Handling negative feedback in-house allows us to take immediate corrective action, leading to higher customer satisfaction.
Stronger Online Reputation: This approach helps maintain a high Google rating by promoting only positive reviews publicly.
